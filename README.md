# Graph Theory Algorithms â€“ Assignment 2 Implementations

This repository contains implementations of several fundamental graph algorithms developed as part of Assignment 2.

Each algorithm is implemented as an independent C++ program with its own `main` function, allowing you to run them separately.

## Algorithms Included:
- **Bellman-Ford**: Computes shortest paths from a single source vertex, handling negative weights.
- **Dijkstra**: Efficient algorithm for shortest paths from a single source with non-negative edge weights.
- **Ford-Fulkerson**: Computes the maximum flow in a flow network.
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Finds the minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.

## Technologies:
- C++

## How to Run:
Compile and run each program independently according to your development environment setup.
